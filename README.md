  - Utilized **Cloudinary** for scalable cloud-based media storage.

- **Advanced Querying**:
  - Implemented **pagination**, **sorting**, and **filtering** features.
  - Case-insensitive search functionality for enhanced accessibility.

- **Secure Authentication**:
  - JWT-based authentication for secure user sessions.
  - Password encryption using **Bcrypt** to protect user data.

- **Data Processing**:
  - Leveraged **MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline** for complex queries and data transformations.

- **API Testing**:
  - Thoroughly tested all endpoints using **Postman**.
  - Created a comprehensive Postman collection for structured and reusable API requests.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**:
